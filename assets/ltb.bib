abstract     = {Type Ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars composed of carbon and oxygen, were instrumental as distance indicators in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. However, the physics of the explosion are debated. Here we report a systematic spectral analysis of a large sample of well-observed type Ia supernovae. Mapping the velocity distribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoretical scenarios. We find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stable iron-group elements. Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova ejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of nickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product of incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in all supernovae, having an expansion velocity of [~]11,000 kilometers per second and corresponding to a mass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the 
supernovae considered here burned similar masses and suggests that their progenitors had the same mass. Synthetic light-curve parameters and three-dimensional explosion simulations support this interpretation. A single explosion scenario, possibly a delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae.},

@article{Yadav2010,
abstract = {In the multi-fractal analysis of large scale matter distribution, the scale of transition to homogeneity is defined as the scale above which the fractal dimension of underlying point distribution is equal to the ambient dimension of the space in which points are distributed. With finite sized weakly clustered distribution of tracers obtained from galaxy redshift surveys it is difficult to achieve this equality. Recently we have defined the scale of homogeneity to be the scale above which the deviation of fractal dimension from the ambient dimension becomes smaller than the statistical dispersion. In this paper we use the relation between the fractal dimensions and the correlation function to compute the dispersion for any given model in the limit of weak clustering amplitude. We compare the deviation and dispersion for the LCDM model and discuss the implication of this comparison for the expected scale of homogeneity in the concordant model of cosmology. We estimate the upper limit to the scale 
of homogeneity to be close to 260 Mpc/h for the LCDM model. Actual estimates of the scale of homogeneity should be smaller than this as we have considered only statistical contribution to the dispersion in fractal dimension and we have ignored cosmic variance and contributions due to survey geometry and the selection function. We find that as long as non linear correction are insignificant, scale of homogeneity as defined above does not change with epoch. The scale of homogeneity depends very weakly on the choice of tracer of the density field. Thus the suggested definition of the scale of homogeneity is fairly robust.},

abstract = {Clowes et al. (2013) have recently reported the discovery of a Large Quasar Group (LQG), dubbed the Huge-LQG, at redshift z\~{}1.3 in the DR7 quasar catalogue of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. On the basis of its characteristic size \~{}500 Mpc and longest dimension >1 Gpc, it is claimed that this structure is incompatible with large-scale homogeneity and the cosmological principle. If true, this would represent a serious challenge to the standard cosmological model. However, the homogeneity scale is an average property which is not necessarily affected by the discovery of a single large structure. I clarify this point and provide the first fractal dimension analysis of the DR7 quasar catalogue to demonstrate that it is in fact homogeneous above scales of at most 130 Mpc/h, which is much less than the upper limit for $\backslash$Lambda CDM. In addition, I show that the algorithm used to identify the Huge-LQG regularly finds even larger clusters of points, extending over Gpc scales, in explicitly 
homogeneous simulations of a Poisson point process with the same density as the quasar catalogue. This provides a simple null test to be applied to any cluster thus found in a real catalogue, and suggests that the interpretation of LQGs as `structures' is misleading.},

The test has the virtue that it does not rely on the assumption that the LRG sample has a finite mean density; its results show, however, that there $\backslash$emph\{is\} such a mean density. Secondly, the survey sky area is divided into 10 disjoint solid angular regions and the fractional rms density variations of the LRG sample in the redshift range \$0.2<z<0.35\$ among these (\$\backslash sim 2\backslash times10\^{}7 h\^{}\{-3\} \backslash mathrm\{Mpc\^{}3\}\$) regions is found to be 7 percent of the mean density.

abstract = {We have made the largest-volume measurement to date of the transition to large-scale homogeneity in the distribution of galaxies. We use the WiggleZ survey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200,000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volume of \~{}1 (Gpc/h)\^{}3. A new method of defining the 'homogeneity scale' is presented, which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and which can be easily compared between different surveys. Due to the large cosmic depth of WiggleZ (up to z=1) we are able to make the first measurement of the transition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. The mean number of galaxies N(<r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r\^{}3 within 1\%, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1\% of D\_2=3, at radii larger than 71 $\backslash$pm 8 Mpc/h at z\~{}0.2, 70 $\backslash$pm 5 Mpc/h at z\~{}0.4, 81 $\backslash$pm 5 Mpc/h at z\~{}0.6, and 75 $\backslash$pm 4 Mpc/h at z\~{}0.8. We demonstrate the robustness of our results 
against selection function effects, using a LCDM N-body simulation and a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. The results are in excellent agreement with both the LCDM N-body simulation and an analytical LCDM prediction. We can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension below D\_2=2.97 on scales from \~{}80 Mpc/h up to the largest scales probed by our measurement, \~{}300 Mpc/h, at 99.99\% confidence.},

In this paper we describe the historical and conceptual origin of the cosmological constant problem which is intimately connected to the vacuum concept in quantum field theory. We critically discuss how the problem rests on the notion of physically real vacuum energy, and which relations between general relativity and quantum field theory are assumed in order to make the problem well-defined.}

@article{Roukema2012a,
abstract = {The approximate homogeneity of spatial sections of the Universe is well supported observationally, but the inhomogeneity of the spatial sections is even better supported. Here, we consider the implications of inhomogeneity in dust models for the connectedness of spatial sections at early times. We consider a non-global Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model designed to match observations, a more general, heuristic model motivated by the former, and two specific, global LTB models. We propose that the generic class of solutions of the Einstein equations projected back in time from the spatial section at the present epoch includes subclasses in which the spatial section evolves (with increasing time) smoothly (i) from being disconnected to being connected, or (ii) from being simply connected to being multiply connected, where the coordinate system is comoving and synchronous. We show that (i) and (ii) each contain at least one exact solution. These subclasses exist because the Einstein equations allow 
non-simultaneous big bang times. The two types of topology evolution occur over time slices that include significantly post-quantum epochs if the bang time varies by much more than a Planck time. In this sense, it is possible for cosmic topology evolution to be "mostly" classical.},

@article{Hellaby2009,
abstract = {An overview of some recent developments in inhomogeneous models is presented. As the volume and precision of cosmological data improves, it will become more and more essential to understand the non-linear behaviour of the Einstein field equations. This requires the study of exact inhomogeneous solutions, including their density distributions, their evolution, their geometry, and their causal structure. Observations are strongly affected by the detailed geometry and evolution of a model, and therefore interpretation of observations depends on understanding them. It is generally assumed the universe is homogeneous if averaged over large enough scales, but to actually prove this is so, will require the assumption to be relaxed, and a rigorous inhomogeneous approach to be applied. Though the $\backslash$LT metric has long been used for models of spherical inhomogeneities, there have been a number of new results, including a variety of methods for creating models with specific properties, and their 
application to cosmic structures on several different scales. Interest in the Szekeres metrics is on the increase, and the quasi-spherical metric was recently used to model specific cosmic structures for the first time. The quasi-planar and quasi-hyperspherical metrics have been hardly studied until recent work invesigated their physical and geometric properties. There is enormous scope for work with these metrics.},
